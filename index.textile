h1. About This Document

Since we've lost the features page of the ExpressionEngine website, lets crowd source our own. If we all take a little time to contribute to listing and describing features, we'll all end up with a fantastic descriptive featueset that we can use to sell to clients. So, fork away. Please keep commentary out of this. It is meant to be factual in nature.

h2. ExpressionEngine Main Description

ExpressionEngine is a content management system written by Ellislab in PHP. It is built on the open source CodeIgniter framework, and uses a MySQL database to store data. It is a commercial product that is downloaded and installed on a web server, then configured to store and serve content according to the needs of the website it is being used on. It is regarded to be extremely flexible and is design and content agnostic. It features a strong set of core functionality and has a plugin architecture, allowing developers to install third-party add-ons to provide additional functionality. It is not a plug and play CMS, most website owners will need to hire a consultant to architect and build an ExpressionEngine system for them to use on their website.

h3. Add-Ons

ExpressionEngine add-ons come in five flavors:

* Modules - Modules can be extremely extensive in functionality, such as an online store, or simple. They can contain all of the below listed types of add-ons within their package. They typically create new functionality both within the Control Panel and on the customer-facing portion of the site.
* Extensions - Extensions can also be extremely extensive or very simple, and create new functionality within the Control Panel.
* Fieldtypes - Developers can create new types of fields that are installable. For instance, Matrix is a fieldtype that adds a very flexible data table-type field to entries. As a developer creates a custom field group for a channel, s/he can choose any installed fieldtype to be a part of it, to capture and store the type of data that is most appropriate for the content being entered.
* Plugins - Plugins can be extensive, but are generally a simple add-on that manupulates content on the customer-facing portion of the site.
* Accessories - Accessories manipulate the Control Panel to change its look and feel or functionality.

h4. Third-Party Add-Ons

One of the most useful features of ExpressionEngine is its plugin architecture. By downloading an add-on created by another developer, or building one of his/her own, a developer can add new functionality to ExpressionEngine that is not present in the core product. There are over 1,000 add-ons catalogued and available for download at http://devot-ee.com. Most add-ons are free, and some are commercial in nature. The add-on community for ExpressionEngine is one of its greatest assets. New add-ons are built and added to Devot-ee weekly.
